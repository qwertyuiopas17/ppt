# The Inspector–Sentry Cascade — complete specification

**NetSentinel Tier 2, as it stands on 13 September 2026.**
Everything needed to understand, run, defend or extend the system, from zero.

**The rule this document is written under:** every number below comes from a
`.json` file produced by a script in this repository, and the file is named
next to the number. Nothing is estimated, rounded up, or carried over from an
earlier draft. If a figure is not in one of those files, it does not appear
here and must not appear on a slide.

---

## 1. The problem

Detect an insider — or a compromised account — moving through cloud services,
using nothing but passively captured network traffic, on a network where you
cannot install anything on the endpoint.

The deployment target is behind a **data diode**: a one-way optical link used
in nuclear, defence and SCADA environments. Traffic leaves, nothing returns.
That rules out EDR agents, active scanning, TLS interception, and any inline
device. What you get is a mirror of egress packets and nothing else.

**The hypothesis.** Someone doing something they shouldn't tends to combine
*categories of service* in a way a machine normally doesn't: an internal recon
API, then a code-paste site, then a messaging API. Each is unremarkable alone.
The combination, on that host, is not.

Most anomaly detection scores flow statistics or individual destinations. A
91-study review of graph-based NIDS found no published system scoring
cross-service category combinations per host. **That is the only novelty
claimed.** The cascade, the knowledge distillation and per-entity baselining
are all established prior art. The Inspector's architecture is GraphIDS-shaped
(arXiv:2509.16625) and is not ours.

---

## 2. Why there are two models

Not cost. That was the original reason and it does not survive measurement: at
100,000 hosts with a teacher a thousand times larger than ours, inspecting
every host-hour for a year costs about **$150** (`gpu_cost.py`). The two
reasons that do survive are structural properties of the models, and both are
asserted numerically in `test_tiers.py` rather than argued.

**1 — The Sentry is causal. The Inspector is not.**
The Sentry's aggregator is per-window and its GRU is unidirectional, so its
score at hour *t* depends only on hours 0..*t*. Measured: scoring a truncated
day equals the corresponding slice of scoring the whole day to within
**4 × 10⁻⁶**. It can answer every hour.
The Inspector is a Transformer with a 24-slot positional embedding, so hour 3's
representation depends on hour 20. Measured drift when handed a partial day:
**0.032**. It cannot answer before the day closes, at any amount of compute.

**2 — The Inspector needs other hosts. The Sentry does not.**
The hop-2 cohort term is the mean of *other* hosts' edges in the same
(day, window, category). Blanking it moves the Inspector's output by **0.410**.
That data does not exist at a single diode-separated site. The Sentry never
asks for it.

Those two facts place the models. They are not preferences.

**Two things people get wrong.** The Sentry runs from **day one**, in parallel,
not after commissioning — commissioning is the only period that produces its
training labels ("would the teacher have flagged this"), so starting it later
throws the training set away. And the Inspector **never fully idles** — it
keeps a blind random audit sample forever, because otherwise nothing detects
the Sentry drifting away from it.

## 4. The data representation

Every input source reduces to one tensor.

```
edges[host, day, window, category, feature]   float32
mask [host, day, window, category]            1.0 where that edge exists
```

24 windows per day, one hour each. A **live** window is one where
`mask.sum(-1) > 0`; empty windows are excluded from every metric.

### 4.1 The nine categories

Which nine depends on the corpus.

| own capture / synthetic (LOTS taxonomy) | LANL cyber1 (port-derived) |
|---|---|
| `Recon_API` | `Directory` — Kerberos / LDAP / GC |
| `Code_Repo_Paste` | `FileShare` — SMB / NFS |
| `Messaging_API` | `RemoteAccess` — RDP / SSH / WinRM / VNC |
| `Cloud_Storage` | `Mail` — SMTP / IMAP / POP |
| `Browse` | `WebProxy` — HTTP(S) / proxy ports |
| `Sync` | `Database` — MSSQL / Oracle / MySQL / PG |
| `CI_CD` | `Infra` — DNS / NTP / SNMP / RPC / syslog |
| `Internal` | `Workstation` — peer-to-peer, low fan-in |
| `Unknown_External` | `Unknown` — numeric-but-unmapped |

`Unknown_External` is a deliberate outcome for ECH, DoH and raw-IP traffic, not
a failure. Lost visibility is itself a signal.

### 4.2 The ten features

| # | feature | what it captures |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `log_n_flows` | volume |
| 1 | `log_bytes_up` | outbound volume |
| 2 | `log_bytes_down` | inbound volume |
| 3 | `egress_asymmetry` | up/down ratio — the exfiltration signal |
| 4 | `iat_cv` | inter-arrival coefficient of variation — beaconing |
| 5 | `ks_uniform` | KS distance from uniform inter-arrivals |
| 6 | `ks_exponential` | KS distance from exponential inter-arrivals |
| 7 | `fft_prominence` | periodicity — automation |
| 8 | `distinct_endpoint_ratio` | → 1.0 means a domain randomiser |
| 9 | `log_duration_mean` | session length |

**The jitter-trap inversion**, which is counter-intuitive and worth being able
to explain: a beacon that adds random jitter to evade timing detection produces
*uniform* inter-arrival times. Humans are log-normal and bursty. So low
`ks_uniform` plus low `fft_prominence` indicates automation — the evasion is
itself the signature.

**On LANL only**, slots 2 and 3 are unusable: cyber1 logs one byte count, not a
directional pair. Those two slots instead carry `new_peer_ratio` and
`new_service_flag`. Without that substitution, LANL within-host AUC was
0.526 ± 0.308 — chance. Volume and timing alone cannot separate a
credential-based hop from an administrator's Tuesday.

---

## 5. Model specifications

### 5.1 EdgeAggregator — shared

```
hop-1 message = MLP([ edge_features(10) ‖ category_embedding(16) ‖ cohort(10)? ])
window vector = MLP([ mean_c(message), max_c(message), presence_mask(9) ])
```

The category embedding is what stops the model memorising infrastructure. The
cohort term is the sampled hop-2 neighbourhood — Inspector only.

One implementation detail that was a real bug: the max-pool must be guarded on
the **true edge count**, not the denominator. The denominator is clamped to ≥1
and so is never zero, which let a `-1e9` sentinel escape into the encoder on
every empty window and blew first-epoch loss to ~1e12.

### 5.2 Inspector — the teacher

| component | params | share |
|---|---|---|
| `seq` — TransformerEncoder ×2, dim 96, 4 heads, ffn 192, norm_first | 149,568 | 72.8% |
| `agg` — EdgeAggregator with cohort | 41,712 | 20.3% |
| `dec` — decoder | 11,818 | 5.7% |
| `pos` — positional embedding, 24 slots | 2,304 | 1.1% |
| `cat_emb` — category embedding | 144 | 0.1% |
| **total** | **205,546** | |

Trained as a **denoising autoencoder**: 25% of present edges are hidden from
the encoder; the decoder must reconstruct all of them. Reconstruction error is
the anomaly score. **Fully unsupervised — it never sees an attack label**, in
training or in threshold selection. Threshold = 99th percentile of
reconstruction error over the commissioning window.

Unit of work: a **whole host-day**, never a single window.

### 5.3 Sentry — the student and router

EdgeAggregator (no cohort) → GRU dim 32, unidirectional → Linear 32→96
projection head. **14,992 parameters.** Deferral head, when used: 2,369.

### 5.4 The distillation

```
L = E[ (1 + λ · s_teacher) · ‖ project(f_student) − f_teacher ‖² ]      λ = 4
```

The Sentry is distilled on the teacher's **encoder representation**, weighted
toward high-anomaly windows — never on its binary verdict. Motivation: MDPI
MAKE 8(3):60 measured that in ordinary distillation, *global* outlier structure
transfers at ~78% while *local* outlier structure transfers at only ~20%. Local
structure is exactly what an anomaly router needs, so it has to be weighted for
explicitly. **Distil the eyes, never the verdict.**

The router predicts *the teacher's decision*, not its own uncertainty.
Confidence-based deferral is provably suboptimal under distribution shift,
specialist downstream models and label noise — all three describe an IDS
(Jitkrittum et al., NeurIPS 2023, arXiv:2307.02764).

---

## 6. The audit dial — coverage of the router's blind spots

A router that misses something never escalates it, and the Inspector never gets
a chance. **Measured miss rate against the teacher at a 5% budget: 3.1%** — the
Sentry recovers 96.9% of the Inspector's flags, so roughly one in thirty-two
dies at the router.

The blind random audit is the only thing that finds the rest, so its rate sets
worst-case detection time:

```
ETTE = 1 / ( audit_rate × P(detect | inspected) )
```

Audit is drawn **before the score is consulted**, which is what makes audited
windows admissible to calibration by provenance rather than by score.

### 6.1 Risk tiers — the dial is per host

| tier | audit | escalation budget | Inspector load | worst-case ETTE (P=0.5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `crown_jewel` | 100% | 100% | 100% | every day |
| `elevated` | 20% | 10% | 33% | 10 days |
| `standard` | 5% | 5% | 13% | 40 days |
| `bulk` | 2% | 5% | 10% | 100 days |

At `audit_rate = 1.0` every host-day reaches the Inspector regardless of the
router — that is exactly "inspect everything", with the hourly Sentry score
kept on top. **The cascade contains full inspection rather than substituting
for it.** A domain controller runs at 1.0 while ten thousand endpoints run at
0.02, in one deployment. A single global mode cannot express that.

What caps the dial is **analyst capacity, not compute** — every audited
host-day the Inspector flags becomes an alert someone must triage.

---

## 7. Operational machinery

### 7.1 Visibility gate — `netsentinel_v2/visibility.py`

A capture fault must not look like an attack. If the sensor stops naming flows,
everything lands in `Unknown_External`, the feature distribution shifts hard,
and the Inspector faithfully reports a large anomaly. It is right that
something changed and wrong about what.

Four outcomes: `score`, `warn_and_score`, `refuse` (raises a **DATA_QUALITY**
ticket, not a security alert), `recommission`. Absolute floor: named-flow ratio
below 0.25 means the resolver is not working.

**The case people get backwards:** a sensor *improvement* invalidates a
baseline exactly as thoroughly as a degradation. Moving snaplen 512 → 0 moved a
large share of encrypted traffic out of `Unknown_External` into real
categories; a baseline fitted before that describes a different world, and
scoring the new corpus against it flags the whole estate on the day the capture
got better. Material improvement is a recommission trigger.

### 7.2 Guarded rolling recalibration — `netsentinel_v2/calibration.py`

Thresholds decay, so they must adapt — but naive adaptation is attackable: a
patient attacker ramps slowly and drags "normal" along. Four guards:

1. **Admission by provenance, not score.** Only blind-audited windows update
   the baseline. An attacker cannot volunteer training data by looking normal,
   because looking normal is not what gets you admitted.
2. **Bounded movement.** Any update moves the threshold by at most a fixed
   number of MAD units.
3. **Freeze on incident.** A host under incident hold does not adapt at all.
4. **Forward-only.** Recalibration never retroactively rescores history.

### 7.3 Lifecycle — `netsentinel_v2/lifecycle.py`

Five states as diagrammed in §3.3. Promotion gates as listed there. Every
threshold is a **starting setting, not a validated constant** — say that when
presenting them. When a host is blocked the system names which gates it failed.

`INCIDENT_HOLD` is deliberately not terminal. "Suspicious hosts stay on the
Inspector forever" sounds safe and is not survivable — false positives,
legitimate change and deliberately noisy traffic would consume the whole budget
within weeks. Release is always explicit and human.

---

## 8. The datasets — what each one can and cannot test

### 8.1 LANL cyber1 — the only real attack labels

Kent (2015), "Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events". 58 days of a
real enterprise network, ~17,700 computers, **749 labelled red-team
authentication events**. From `https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/`;
`flows.txt.gz` and `redteam.txt.gz`.

**Configuration used:** `--max-hosts 500 --lanl-days 13`. Keeps the 500 busiest
hosts by client-side flow count, then force-includes 112 red-team computers
that had client traffic but did not rank — evaluating attack recall on a host
set that excludes the attacked hosts would be worthless. Result **H = 612 hosts
× 13 days**; commissioning days 0–5, validation gap 6–7, test days 8–12;
**39,492 live test windows, 131 attack windows on 80 hosts**, of which 77 hosts
carrying 106 positives are scoreable for within-host AUC.

**What it cannot test.** Every computer is de-identified to `C1065`, so there
are no nameable SaaS destinations and the LOTS taxonomy would collapse to ~100%
`Internal`. The loader substitutes a port-derived taxonomy — measured
distribution FileShare 29.0%, Infra 24.6%, Directory 17.2%, WebProxy 16.8%,
Workstation 6.5%, Unknown 4.0%, Database 1.1%, RemoteAccess 0.6%, Mail 0.1%.
**LANL evaluates a proxy task**, not the cross-service hypothesis.

Two loader details that are load-bearing: LANL does not normalise flow
direction and anonymises ephemeral ports as `N#####`, so the service port is
taken as `min(numeric ports)` and the endpoint holding the ephemeral port is
treated as the client — a destination-port resolver gets the direction
backwards on the dataset's own example row. And fan-in thresholds for "is this
a server" are measured from a first streaming pass (p90/p99), not hard-coded.

Labels are auth events naming a source and destination computer;
`label_policy=both` marks both. Measured on this run: **1 of 4** red-team
source computers and **119 of 301** destinations were modelled hosts — most
destinations are servers with no client-side traffic.

**Caching.** Both expensive passes are cached (`lanl_profile.json`,
`lanl_tensors_H612_D13_nov1_b6.npz`). With both present the raw 12 GB file is
not needed at all — only `redteam.txt` for the labels. The cache key encodes
hosts, days and the novelty flag.

### 8.2 Synthetic generator — `netsentinel_v2/synth.py`

Full 9-category LOTS taxonomy, real egress semantics, injected LOTS-LSA chains.
Tests the mechanism where the hypothesis can fire. **Not** evidence of
real-world performance — a detector evaluated on the generator that produced
its attacks is partly learning the generator.

`hard_negatives=True` by default and it matters: without it, one trivial rule —
"the host with the longest unbroken `Messaging_API` run" — scores AUC **1.000**.
With hard negatives (35% "chatty" hosts, 25% "poller" hosts) it drops to
**0.797**.

### 8.3 Our own capture — the only corpus with named egress

Six laptops, dumpcap ring buffer, hourly rotation, Windows scheduled task as
SYSTEM. **snaplen 0 (whole packets) since 12 Sep 12:03 IST.** The only corpus
that can test the actual hypothesis. Does not yet have enough post-fix days for
a commissioning/test split.

### 8.4 Evaluated and rejected

| dataset | why |
|---|---|
| WRCCDC 2018 | 1,021,950 conn records, 15,070 SNI names, 664 hosts, 77.3% resolver hit rate — but **one day only**, so no host can be baselined |
| Stratosphere Normal Captures | host unreachable from our network |
| Unified Host and Network (2017) | has directional bytes, **no red-team labels**. Labels or directionality, not both |

---

## 9. Every measured number

### 9.1 Sensor — `capture_probe.json`

2 files, 173,682 packets.

| | measured |
|---|---|
| snaplen recorded in files | 262,144 (dumpcap "whole packet") |
| packets truncated | **0 (0.0%)** |
| TLS ClientHellos seen | 342 |
| hostname recovered | **308 (90.1%)** |
| median snaplen needed | 654 bytes |
| 95th percentile | 2,041 bytes |
| ClientHellos split across TCP segments | **159 (46.5%)** |
| Encrypted Client Hello present | 32 |
| plaintext DNS queries readable | 1,002 |
| distinct names queried | 65 |
| DoH endpoint connections | 0 |
| distinct named destinations | 55 |

**Snaplen coverage:** 160 → 0.0% of ClientHellos whole · 512 → 16.7% ·
1024 → 53.5% · **1500 → 53.5%** · 2048 → 95.6% · 4096 → 100%.

Note the flatline between 1024 and 1500 — that is the ethernet MTU. Once a
handshake exceeds one packet a bigger capture buffer cannot help. **46.5% need
TCP reassembly**, which is Zeek's job. Two claims, not one: whole packets fix
*truncation*, Zeek reassembly handles *fragmentation*.

**Why snaplen 0.** At 512, **0 of 805 QUIC Initial packets** were readable —
RFC 9000 requires a client Initial padded to ≥1,200 bytes, measured median
1,230. QUIC hostname recovery uses the salt published in RFC 9001 §5.2 plus the
client's own cleartext Connection ID; anyone can compute it, only the SNI is
extracted, no user payload is decrypted. Verified against the RFC's Appendix
A.1 vectors — **16 checks, all exact**. Requires the `cryptography` package.

**Retracted, so nobody reintroduces it:** an earlier "55% of DNS hidden by DoH"
figure counted bootstrap lookups *of the resolver's own hostname*. We cannot
see hidden queries, so we have no denominator. Report counts, never a
percentage.

### 9.2 LANL cyber1 — `lanl_novelty.json`, `lanl_novelty_hn.json`, 3 seeds

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| Router A AUC — agreement with the teacher | **0.992 ± 0.003** |
| Router B AUC | 0.634 ± 0.007 |
| Inspector pooled AUC, window-level | 0.745 ± 0.002 ⚠ **confounded** |
| Inspector pooled AUC, day-level | 0.639 ± 0.004 |
| **Inspector within-host AUC** | **0.557 ± 0.013** |
| Inspector flag rate | 2.56% |
| kNN geometry overlap @20 | 0.439 |
| runtime, 3 seeds, CPU | 843 s |

**Escalation budget curve** (router A, window-level, 3-seed mean):

| budget | recall of the *teacher's flags* | recall of *actual attacks* |
|---|---|---|
| 1% | 37.7% | 11.5% |
| 2% | 68.0% | 19.3% |
| 5% | **96.9%** | **35.6%** |
| 10% | 99.0% | 44.3% |

**These two columns are different quantities.** 96.9% is routing fidelity — how
much of the Inspector's own output the Sentry recovers. 35.6% is how many real
attacks were caught. Never say "96.9% recall" without "of the Inspector's
flags". Never quote a Tier 2 detection rate as a product claim. "95% recall"
was once proposed and is withdrawn.

### 9.3 The busy-host confound

Attacked hosts in LANL are simply *busier*: live-window density **0.811** vs
**0.530**. Scoring each window against its own host's commissioning
distribution (`--host-normalise`):

| metric | baseline | per-host scored | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| pooled window AUC | 0.745 ± 0.002 | **0.618 ± 0.021** | **−0.127** |
| pooled day-level AUC | 0.639 ± 0.004 | 0.487 ± 0.024 | −0.152 |
| within-host AUC | 0.557 ± 0.013 | 0.560 ± 0.015 | +0.003 |
| flag rate | 2.6% | 2.0% | −0.6 pts |

Within-host did not move, and that is arithmetic rather than failure: it ranks
each host's windows against that host's own, and a per-host z-score is strictly
increasing inside each host, so it cannot change a ranking. The +0.003 residual
comes from 32 of 612 hosts having under 20 live commissioning windows and
falling back to the pooled scale.

**The pooled collapse is the finding.** Most of the gap between 0.745 and 0.557
was cross-host busyness. **0.557 is the confound-free number, it is near
chance, and 0.745 must never be quoted without this attached.** One alternative
reading cannot be excluded: if attacked hosts are busier *because* compromised,
per-host scoring destroyed real signal. Nothing here distinguishes those.

### 9.4 Is the graph model worth its parameters? — `lanl_p0b.json`, `paired_synth.json`, `lanl_ensemble.json`

The baseline: per host, a median and a MAD over that host's own commissioning
windows; score = mean squared robust z over the flattened (category × feature)
bag. No graph, no attention, no embedding, no cohort, no training, no order.
Scored on exactly the rows the Inspector scored.

**On LANL**, paired over the 77 hosts both cover:

| | pooled | within-host |
|---|---|---|
| Inspector (205,546 params) | 0.741 | 0.542 ± 0.310 |
| bag Mahalanobis (~0 params) | 0.627 | **0.578 ± 0.273** |

Inspector wins **36**, bag wins **40**, 1 tie, mean difference −0.036,
exact two-sided sign test **p = 0.731**.

**On synthetic data that does contain the chain** — 700 hosts, 16 days, 3
seeds, 150 paired hosts (the test would detect an 88–62 split):

| | value |
|---|---|
| mean within-host AUC | Inspector **0.757**, bag **0.732** (+0.025) |
| mean pooled AUC | Inspector 0.741, bag 0.710 (+0.031) |
| paired win rate | 70 / 80 |
| sign test | **p = 0.46** |
| median paired difference | **−0.007** |

Mean positive, median negative: **the Inspector wins large on a minority of
hosts and loses small on the majority.** Its value is concentrated, not general.

**Combining them does not help.** Six methods on LANL:

| scorer | within-host AUC |
|---|---|
| bag-Mahalanobis | 0.578 |
| ensemble min(z) | 0.569 |
| ensemble mean(z) | 0.568 |
| ensemble max(z) | 0.568 |
| ensemble mean(rank) | 0.557 |
| Inspector | 0.542 |

**All six between 0.54 and 0.58.** That is not "our model is bad" — it is *the
task is not solvable on this corpus by any method we can build*. Accuracy does
not discriminate.

### 9.5 Router selection — `results.json` (synthetic), `lanl_novelty.json` (LANL)

| router | synthetic AUC | LANL AUC |
|---|---|---|
| **A — distilled detector**, regresses the continuous teacher score | **0.876** | **0.992 ± 0.003** |
| B — encoder + per-host Mahalanobis (KMeans k=3, Ledoit-Wolf, 5% trim) | 0.818 ± 0.046 | 0.634 ± 0.007 |
| C — deferral head, BCE on "would the teacher flag this" | 0.850 | not run |

**Build A.** B is rejected — it also carried ~7× the seed variance of the
learned heads. It depends on the student preserving the teacher's geometry, and
preservation is only partial: kNN overlap@20 is 0.35 synthetic, 0.44 LANL.
Report that overlap alongside any recall claim, and re-check it whenever
student capacity or the distillation loss changes.

**Synthetic budget curve** (router A, 3 seeds) — much lower than LANL because
the synthetic attacks are stealthier by construction:

| budget | teacher's flags | attacks |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5% | 6.1% | 2.1% |
| 1% | 11.2% | 3.6% |
| 2% | 20.2% | 6.8% |
| 5% | 37.1% | 17.3% |
| 10% | 52.0% | 30.1% |

### 9.6 Throughput — `escalate.json`, all on the same single CPU core

| | windows/sec |
|---|---|
| Inspector | 70,950 |
| Sentry | **609,187** |
| hop-2 cohort computation | 1,869,524 |

**The Sentry is 8.6× faster, not 13.7×.** 13.7 is the parameter ratio and is
not a speed claim. The cohort computation is not the bottleneck.

⚠ **Do not carry 8.6× onto a GPU slide.** It is CPU-to-CPU. The Inspector's
Transformer parallelises across all 24 windows; the Sentry's GRU is 24
sequential steps a GPU cannot parallelise. On GPU the gap shrinks and may
invert — which is precisely why the Sentry belongs on CPU. Present it as a
placement decision backed by a benchmark you have run.

### 9.7 Order ablation — `ablation_order_hard.json`, 3 seeds, 120 hosts, 16 days

Permuting the hour axis is a *complete* ablation of order, because order enters
the model only via the positional embedding and the Transformer's attention.

| condition | AUC |
|---|---|
| A — full model | 0.998 ± 0.001 |
| B — hours shuffled at scoring | 0.998 ± 0.001 |
| C — hours shuffled at train *and* score | 0.997 ± 0.001 |
| **D — bag of categories, order-free** | **1.000 ± 0.000** |
| E — Markov transitions only | 0.444 ± 0.055 |
| F — no reverse-direction features | 0.996 ± 0.002 |

**A − B = 0.000. The model is order-blind**, and an order-free baseline scores
*better*. Therefore **"we detect the sequence" is withdrawn**; the claim is
**"we detect the combination and the shape."**

F is good news for the diode story: losing reverse-direction features costs
0.002 AUC, so the system genuinely survives unidirectional visibility.

Note also that 149,568 + 2,304 = **74% of the Inspector is the part this
ablation shows contributes nothing measurable.**

### 9.8 Cross-organisation transfer — `shift_results.json`

Two synthetic worlds, different role mixes, work hours, volumes, off-hours rates.

| | world A | world B |
|---|---|---|
| Inspector AUC | 0.881 ± 0.008 | 0.852 ± 0.004 |
| router AUC | 0.804 ± 0.040 | 0.825 ± 0.011 |
| attack recall @5% | 31.4% ± 7.5% | 37.2% ± 3.1% |
| flag rate | 6.8% | 6.3% |

**The mechanism transfers; the threshold does not.** A's 99th-percentile
threshold produces 6.3% in world B — a 1.13× ratio — and 6.8% in world A's
*own* test period, so it decays over time, not merely across networks.

### 9.9 The escalation loop — `escalate.json`, 200 hosts × 16 days, 5% window budget

| | measured |
|---|---|
| windows escalated | 1,282 |
| host-days the Inspector re-ran on | **790 of 1,600 (49%)** |
| host-days confirmed at 3σ | 529 |
| confirmation precision | **12.7%** |

**Budget granularity.** The Inspector's unit is a host-day. The top 5% of
*windows* scatters across 49% of *host-days* — a **9.8×** multiplier. This is
why `tiers.py` budgets in host-days: `budget_cut` takes a quantile over
per-host-day peaks. Measured after the fix: **7.5% of host-days against a 10%
budget** — no scatter.

Confirmation precision of 12.7% means the 3σ threshold is far too loose.

### 9.10 Option C on a mixed fleet — `deploy_c.json`, 200 hosts × 8 days

Tier mix: 2 crown_jewel, 11 elevated, 117 standard, 70 bulk.

**Detection latency.** Sentry raised its peak at **hour 17** (IQR 15–19)
against an Inspector that could not have answered before hour 24 — a median of
**7 hours earlier**.

**Inspector load, by cause** — 173 of 1,600 host-days (10.8%):

| reason | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| audit | 89 | 51.4% |
| router | 77 | 44.5% |
| commissioning | 7 | 4.0% |

Escalation is **budgeted**, audit is **chosen**, churn is **absorbed**. Quoting
one figure for "Inspector load" hides which of the three is moving.

**The dial, same fleet:**

| audit rate | host-days inspected | fraction | ETTE @ P=0.5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2% | 110 | 6.9% | 100 days |
| 5% | 158 | 9.9% | 40 days |
| 20% | 376 | 23.5% | 10 days |
| **100%** | **1,600** | **100%** | every day |

*(Untrained models — this demonstrates architecture behaviour, not detection
performance.)*

### 9.11 Cost — `gpu_cost.py`

At 100,000 hosts, inspecting **everything** for a year:

| teacher size | inspect-all $/yr | cascade $/yr | saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 205,546 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| 2,000,000 | $2 | $0 | $1 |
| 20,000,000 | $15 | $2 | $13 |
| 200,000,000 | $150 | $16 | $135 |

Scaling the fleet with a 200M-parameter teacher: 100k → $150/yr · 1M →
$1,502 · 10M → $15,017 · 100M → $150,170.

**Below roughly ten million hosts, do not lead with GPU cost.** The saving is
arithmetically real and economically irrelevant. At vendor-multi-tenant or
national-infrastructure scale it becomes a genuine six-figure line.

**Where the money actually is**, same 100,000 hosts:

```
alerts/day, inspect everything :      2,560
alerts/day, cascade            :      2,481      ← only 3.1% lower
analysts needed                :        113
analyst spend                  : $  9,054,336 /yr
wasted on false positives      : $  7,904,435 /yr   at 12.7% precision
```

**The cascade does not reduce alert volume, by design** — a faithful router
that recovers 96.9% of the teacher's flags necessarily passes 96.9% of the
alerts through. It saves *inspection*, not *triage*. Alert volume is controlled
by the **confirmation threshold**, and at 12.7% precision that single untuned
number is worth **$7.9M/year** — more than every compute optimisation in the
architecture combined.

### 9.12 Test coverage

| file | checks |
|---|---|
| `test_lanl_loader.py` | 53 |
| `test_contracts.py` | 32 feature-contract checks |
| `test_lifecycle.py` | 19 visibility-gate + state-machine |
| `test_tiers.py` | 17 Option C — causality, cohort, the dial |
| `test_quic.py` | 16 vs RFC 9001 Appendix A.1 vectors |
| `test_calibration.py` | poisoning demo + audit-budget sweep |

Justification: **latency and data locality**, both structural, both measured.

| | before | after | why |

| **Handover** | Inspector stops | **Inspector never stops** — escalations + permanent blind audit | Without the audit, nothing detects the Sentry drifting from the teacher; and the audit is the only cover for the router's measured 3.1% miss rate |
| **Promotion** | 14-day timer | **evidence gate** — 240 live windows, 10 distinct days, a weekend seen, 200 reference samples, drift ≤0.35σ, disagreement ≤0.20 | A timer promotes a quiet server that showed you nothing exactly as readily as a busy laptop that showed you everything |
| **Where each runs** | unspecified | **Sentry at the edge, Inspector central** | Sentry needs no hop-2 cohort (measured: blanking cohort moves the Inspector 0.410); it can sit at a diode-separated site where the Inspector structurally cannot |
| **Detection cadence** | daily | **hourly (Sentry) + daily (Inspector)** | Sentry is causal — proven to 4×10⁻⁶. Measured 7 hours earlier, median |
| **Escalation budget** | 5% of windows | **budgeted in host-days** | 5% of windows re-ran the Inspector on 49% of host-days — a 9.8× scatter. Now 7.5% against a 10% budget |
| **Coverage of router misses** | not addressed | **per-host audit dial**, 2% → 100% | At 100% the cascade *is* full inspection, per host. A crown-jewel asset and a kiosk get different coverage in one deployment |
| **What crosses on escalation** | the flagged window | **the day + preceding days + trigger hour + visibility + state + reason** | Handing the Inspector one isolated hour removes the combination the hypothesis is about |
| **Threshold** | fixed after commissioning | **guarded rolling recalibration** | Threshold decays over time, not just across networks (6.8% flag rate in world A's own test period). Naive adaptation is poisonable |
| **Capture faults** | not distinguished | **visibility gate** — refuses to score, raises DATA_QUALITY | A sensor change, in either direction, shifts the feature distribution and the model faithfully reports an anomaly about the wrong thing |
| **"We detect the sequence"** | claimed | **withdrawn** — "combination and shape" | Permuting the hour axis changes AUC by 0.000 |
| **Cost claim** | 94.7% GPU reduction | **withdrawn** — lead with "no GPU needed at the edge tier" | 94.7% → 92.7% with audit → 45.7% at the real budget granularity → and the absolute figure is $150/yr |
| **Speed claim** | 13.7× | **8.6×**, measured, CPU-to-CPU only | 13.7 is the parameter ratio, not a speed measurement |

## 11. Open work, in priority order

1. **Run the own-capture corpus.** The only corpus that can test the actual
   cross-service hypothesis. Five days of snaplen-0 data ≈ 17 September. Run
   the same three tests already scripted: Inspector, bag baseline, paired sign
   test. Both outcomes are presentable.
2. **Tune the confirmation threshold.** 12.7% precision; worth $7.9M/year at
   100k hosts. The largest number in the economic model and a one-dimensional
   sweep.
3. **Wire the trained router head into `EdgeTier`.** It takes a scoring
   callable; the demo passes a stand-in. One-line change once there is a
   checkpoint from the own corpus.
4. **Test whether the Transformer earns its place.** 74% of the Inspector is
   the Transformer plus positional embedding, and the order ablation says that
   path contributes 0.000. An "Inspector-lite" — aggregator + cohort +
   mean-pool, roughly 54,000 params — run through the §9.4 paired comparison.
5. **Decide the cohort's scope at multi-site scale.** Global cohort means
   shipping every site's tensor centrally — a data-movement and cross-tenant
   privacy problem. Per-site means each Inspector's cohort covers a different
   population than it trained on, which the visibility gate would correctly
   flag. Neither is fatal; both need a decision.
6. **Re-measure the recall curve at host-day granularity** so the cost claim
   and the recall claim describe the same system.

## 12. Claims discipline

**Say these**

- "The Sentry is a router, not a detector."
- "96.9% of the *Inspector's flags* are recovered at a 5% budget."
- "Within-host AUC 0.557 ± 0.013 on LANL. That is near chance, and it is our
  weakest number." — lead with this if asked what is weakest.
- "We detect the combination and the shape."
- "The Inspector is GraphIDS-shaped, arXiv:2509.16625. Ours is the
  cross-service category semantics and the chain dataset."
- "8.6× faster by measured throughput, CPU to CPU."
- "The edge tier needs no GPU at all."
- "At 100% audit the cascade *is* full inspection — it contains it."

**Never say these**

- "95% recall", or "96.9% recall" without "of the Inspector's flags"
- any Tier 2 detection rate as a product claim
- "0.745" without the busy-host confound attached
- "13.7× faster" — parameter ratio, not a speed measurement
- "94.7% GPU reduction" — withdrawn
- "we detect the sequence" — withdrawn by ablation
- "55% of DNS is hidden by DoH" — retracted, no denominator
- state of the art / novel transformer / replaces EDR / the Inspector
  architecture is ours

**The stance that makes this work.** Every retraction above was found by us,
testing our own claims, and written down before anyone asked. A panel that
catches a team hiding a weakness punishes it; a panel that watches a team argue
against itself and survive does the opposite. The 0.557, the order ablation,
the paired tie and the $150 are not damage — they are the evidence that the
remaining numbers can be trusted.

`capture_probe.py --limit N` sorts filenames alphabetically and takes the last
N. The capture ring restarted its numbering, so old high-numbered files sort
after new low-numbered ones and you will silently probe the wrong era.
